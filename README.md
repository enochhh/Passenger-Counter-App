## Why Did I Do This Seemingly Easy Project? 
It is currently December 29, 2021 at 12:07 A.M.. I spent a couple hours today diving into JavaScript. For the past month or so, I was simply reading through documentation and "taking notes" by copying and pasting documentation into my own Google Docs. I had no exposure to actually coding in JavaScript, and the whole idea of JavaScript and web development was just very daunting to me (as well as the idea of using GitHub, but I went through a tutorial just a couple days ago and now I'm trying to get comfortable with it). This project is me not just dipping my toes into the water that is JavaScript and web development, but cannon-balling in. I've been trying to break into the field of software development with an electrical engineering degree, and it feels like I know nothing. The more I learn, the more lost and uneducated I feel. 

Starting July of 2021, I was grinding LeetCode just to tackle data structures and algorithms. I was doing 7 problems a day just to get exposure to them, and I got burnt out. I stopped doing them around September, and haven't touched it since. Coding is hard, man. I've started so many tutorials just to not finish them because I keep overwhelming myself with the stuff I have to learn to become a competent enough software engineer to get hired that I try to take on too many things at once. This "easy" project is me focusing on JavaScript and learning how to become a developer, one step at a time.  

## What Did I Learn?
Some things I learned in this project were 
    - Using the script tag
    - Working with variables, numbers, and strings
    - Using console.log() 
    - Creating functions
    - What the DOM is
    - Using getElementById() to manipulate HTML elements
    - Using innerText and textContent and their differences
